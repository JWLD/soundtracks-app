### What is this?
I wanted to create an app where the user can browse a comprehensive list of film / game / tv composers and their works, and then listen to them via embedded platforms like Spotify and YouTube. Existing catalogues (like Spotify) are often incomplete and contain a confusing mixture of albums / compilations / covers etc.

The main purpose of this app is to render this data in a simple, intuitive interface. I've created a [second app](https://github.com/JWLD/data-react) to make sourcing this data from different APIs as easy as possible.
